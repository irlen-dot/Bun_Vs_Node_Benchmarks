# Bun vs Node Benchmarks

The whole script was written with Claude and it does not proccess any network operations.

So, basically, Bun is quite faster in overall with a approx 100 ms difference.

The purpose of the benchmarks is to choose a runtime env in which I will run my pump fun sniper bot prototype.


Required, to have bun and node installed

## How to run

1. 
```
bun bench.js
```

2. 
```
node bench.js
```
